# Windows Autopilot configuration requirements

*Applies to:*

- Windows 11
- Windows 10
- Windows Holographic, version 2004 or later

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about using Windows Autopilot to deploy HoloLens 2 devices, see [Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2](/hololens/hololens2-autopilot).

Before Windows Autopilot can be used, some configuration tasks are required to support the common Autopilot scenarios.

- Configure Azure Active Directory automatic enrollment. For Microsoft Intune, see [Enable Windows automatic enrollment](/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enroll#enable-windows-automatic-enrollment) for details. If using a different MDM service, contact the vendor for the specific URLs or configuration needed for those services.
- Configure Azure Active Directory custom branding. To display an organization-specific logon page, you must configure Azure Active Directory with the images and text that you want to be displayed. For more information, see [Quickstart: Add company branding to your sign-in page in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/customize-branding). Key elements for Autopilot include the "square logo", "sign-in page text", and Azure Active Directory tenant name. The tenant name is configured separately in the Azure AD tenant properties.
- The first logon user needs to have Azure Active Directory join permissions for all deployment scenarios, except for Windows Autopilot self-deployment mode as this method works in a userless context.
- Optional: To automatically step up from Windows Pro to Windows Enterprise, enable [Windows Subscription Activation](/windows/deployment/windows-10-enterprise-subscription-activation).

Specific scenarios will then have additional requirements. Generally, there are two specific tasks:

- Device registration. Devices must be added to Windows Autopilot to support most Windows Autopilot scenarios. For more information, see [Adding devices to Windows Autopilot](add-devices.md).
- Profile configuration. Once devices have been added to Windows Autopilot, a profile of settings needs to be applied to each device. See [Configure Autopilot profiles](profiles.md) for details.  Microsoft Intune can automate this profile assignment. For more information, see [Create an Autopilot device group](enrollment-autopilot.md) and [Assign an Autopilot deployment profile to a device group](profiles.md).

For more information, see [Windows Autopilot Scenarios](windows-Autopilot-scenarios.md).

There are no additional hardware requirements to use Autopilot, beyond the requirements to run [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications) or [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications).
