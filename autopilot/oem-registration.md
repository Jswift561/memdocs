# OEM registration

*Applies to:*

- Windows 11
- Windows 10
- Windows Holographic, version 2004

## Device registration process

When you purchase devices from an OEM, that OEM can automatically register the devices with the Windows Autopilot. For the list of OEMs that support registration, see the **Participant device manufacturers and resellers** section of the [Windows Autopilot page](https://aka.ms/windowsautopilot).

> [!NOTE]
>
> While the hardware hashes (also known as hardware IDs) are generated as part of the OEM device manufacturing process, these are not generally provided directly to customers or CSP partners. Instead, the OEM should register devices on the customer's behalf. In cases where devices are being registered by CSP partners, OEMs may provide PKID information to those partners to support the device registration process.

OEMs must follow [device guidelines](autopilot-device-guidelines.md) for Windows Autopilot devices.

### Service data

Windows Autopilot is managed and maintained by Microsoft. This service provides the backend database that associates hardware hashes with customer tenants. When an OEM registers devices for a customer, they are writing that data to this database and not directly to the customer's tenant. No permissions to the customer's tenant are granted or required for OEMs to register devices on the customer's behalf.

### Customer consent

Before an OEM can register devices for an organization, the organization must grant the OEM permission to do so. The OEM begins this process with approval granted by an Azure AD global administrator from your organization. For more information see [OEM authorization](registration-auth.md#oem-authorization).

## Microsoft Surface registration

For Surface devices, see [Surface registration support for Windows Autopilot](/surface/surface-autopilot-registration-support).
