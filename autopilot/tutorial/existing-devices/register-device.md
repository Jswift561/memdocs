# Windows Autopilot deployment for existing devices: Register device for Windows Autopilot

Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join steps:
- Step 1: [Set up a Windows Autopilot profile](setup-autopilot-profile.md)
- Step 2: [Install required modules to obtain Autopilot profile(s) from Intune](install-modules.md)
- Step 3: [Create JSON file for Autopilot profile(s)](create-json-file.md)
- Step 4: [Create and distribute package for JSON file in Configuration Manager](create-json-package.md)
- Step 5: [Create Autopilot task sequence in Configuration Manager](create-autopilot-task-sequence.md)
- Step 6: [Create collection in Configuration Manager](create-collection.md)
- Step 7: [Deploy Autopilot task sequence to collection in Configuration Manager](deploy-autopilot-task-sequence.md)
- Step 8: [Speed up the deployment process (optional)](speed-up-deployment.md)
- Step 9: [Run Autopilot task sequence on device](run-autopilot-task-sequence.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot deployment for existing devices workflow, see [Windows Autopilot deployment for existing devices in Intune and Configuration Manager](existing-devices-workflow.md#workflow)

## Register device for Windows Autopilot

Running the Autopilot for existing devices task sequence and the Autopilot deployment on a device doesn't automatically register the device for Windows Autopilot. The Autopilot profile JSON makes the Autopilot deployment available to the device and allows the device to run that particular Autopilot deployment, but it doesn't register the device for Windows Autopilot. If the device ever undergoes a reset, when it runs Windows Setup and OOBE for the first time after the reset, it won't run the Autopilot deployment again even though it has previously run an Autopilot deployment.

To ensure that the device can run an Autopilot deployment after a reset, you must register the device for Windows Autopilot. You can register a device by using one of the following methods:

1. [Manually register devices with Windows Autopilot](../../add-devices.md): Manually registering a device includes manually registering devices into Intune as an Autopilot device via the hardware hash. The hardware hash of a device can be collected via one of the following methods:

   - [Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/comanage/how-to-prepare-Win10#windows-autopilot)
   - [PowerShell script](/mem/autopilot/add-devices#powershell)
   - [Diagnostics page hash export](/mem/autopilot/add-devices#diagnostics-page-hash-export)
   - [Desktop hash export](/mem/autopilot/add-devices#desktop-hash-export)

1. In an Autopilot profile that is deployed to a device group that the device is a member of, make sure the option **Convert all targeted devices to Autopilot** is set to **Yes**. For more information on creating and assigning Autopilot profiles, see one of the following articles on creating and assigning an Autopilot profile for each of the different Autopilot scenarios:

   - [User-driven Azure AD join: Create and assign user-driven Azure AD join Autopilot profile](../user-driven/azure-ad-join-autopilot-profile.md)
   - [User-driven hybrid Azure AD join: Create and assign user-driven hybrid Azure AD join Autopilot profile](../user-driven/hybrid-azure-ad-join-autopilot-profile.md)
   - [Pre-provisioning Azure AD join: Create and assign a pre-provisioned Azure AD join Autopilot profile](../pre-provisioning/azure-ad-join-autopilot-profile.md)
   - [Pre-provisioning hybrid Azure AD join: Create and assign a pre-provisioned hybrid Azure AD join Autopilot profile](../pre-provisioning/hybrid-azure-ad-join-autopilot-profile.md)
   - [Self-deploying mode: Create and assign self-deploying Autopilot profile](../self-deploying/self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md)

## Importing the hardware hash CSV file for devices into Intune

[!INCLUDE [Importing the hardware hash CSV file for devices into Intune](../includes/import-hardware-hash.md)]

## Ensure domain join profile is assigned to all devices

For Autopilot scenarios that utilize hybrid Azure AD join and run after the Windows Autopilot deployment for existing devices task sequence completes, at [Step 8: Configure and assign domain join profile](../user-driven/hybrid-azure-ad-join-domain-join-profile.md) for the [Windows Autopilot user-driven hybrid Azure AD join](../user-driven/hybrid-azure-ad-join-workflow.md) scenario or [Step 8: Configure and assign domain join profile](../pre-provisioning/hybrid-azure-ad-join-domain-join-profile.md) for the [Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment hybrid Azure AD join](../pre-provisioning/hybrid-azure-ad-join-workflow.md) scenario, make sure that the domain join profile is assigned to **All devices**. The domain join profile needs to be assigned to **All devices** because:

- If the existing device hasn't ever joined Azure AD or been registered in Azure AD before the Autopilot deployment runs, then there isn't any Azure AD device for the device in Intune. The Azure AD device is created in Intune when the device joins or registers with Azure AD as part of the Autopilot deployment.

- If the existing device hasn't ever registered as an Autopilot device before the Autopilot deployment runs, then there isn't any Autopilot device for the device in Intune. Normally a device has to be an Autopilot device before the Autopilot deployment can run on it. However, for the Windows Autopilot deployment for existing devices scenario, registering the device as an Autopilot device isn't required since it uses the Autopilot profile JSON file instead. The device is instead registered as an Autopilot device after the Autopilot deployment completes via the methods in the [Register device for Windows Autopilot](#register-device-for-windows-autopilot) section.

In both of the above scenarios, there's no device that can be added to a device group before the Autopilot deployment begins. Since there's no device group that contains the device, there's no device group that the domain join profile can be assigned to before the Autopilot deployment begins. Assigning the domain join profile to **All devices** resolves this problem and ensures that the device can pick up the domain join profile before it's either an Azure AD device or Autopilot device.
