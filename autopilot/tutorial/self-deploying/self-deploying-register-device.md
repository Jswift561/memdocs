# Self-deploying mode: Register devices as Autopilot devices

Autopilot self-deploying mode steps:
- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](self-deploying-automatic-enrollment.md)
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Step 2: Register devices as Autopilot devices**
- Step 3: [Create a device group](self-deploying-device-group.md)
- Step 4: [Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](self-deploying-esp.md)
- Step 5: [Create and assign Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md)
- Step 6: [Deploy the device](self-deploying-deploy-device.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode workflow, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying overview](self-deploying-workflow.md#workflow)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you have already registered devices as Autopilot devices from another Autopilot scenario, you can skip this step and move on to [Step 3: Create a device group](self-deploying-device-group.md). However, if you're deploying multiple different Autopilot scenarios to different devices, separate device groups are required for each Autopilot scenario.
