# Android device is rooted so you can't connect  
 
Your organization can block your device from accessing work or school resources when:  

- You install an app on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. For example, if you're prompted to unroot your device immediately after you install an app, uninstall the app and then check to see if you regain access.    

- Your device manufacturer installed software on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. Contact your IT support person for help. For contact information, go to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) or sign in to the Intune Company Portal app.  

- You rooted the device. Reverse the root (commonly done with PC software or apps) and restore the device back to its previous state. Make sure to back up your device before you begin. 

## Why your access is blocked

Rooting a device involves changing its software. These changes make the device more prone to unauthorized access and malicious attacks. So that's why rooted devices are often blocked from accessing company email or files.
