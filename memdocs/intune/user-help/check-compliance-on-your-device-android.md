# Check compliance in Company Portal app for Android     
*Applies to Intune Company Portal app for Android*  

Use the Intune Company Portal app to remotely check the status of an enrolled device, and confirm or resolve access issues caused by noncompliant settings. During a status check, Company Portal checks your device to make sure it meets your organization's requirements. If your device doesn't meet requirements, your organization may limit or restrict the device from accessing work resources until you make changes.     

>[!TIP]
> After you update the settings on a noncompliant device, we recommend running another status check to register the changes with the Company Portal app.  

1. Sign in to the Company Portal app for Android with your work account.  

2. Tap **Devices** and then select your device.  

3. Tap **Check device settings**. Wait while Company Portal checks your device.  

4. After the check, your device settings status changes to **In Compliance** or **Not in Compliance**. If you're required to make any changes, the message **You need to update settings on this device** appears at the top of the screen. Tap the message for more details. 

For more help, contact your IT support person. Go to the **Support** tab in the Company Portal app for contact information. You can also access support details and device actions on the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
