# Using the Intune Company Portal website
Use the Intune Company Portal website to remotely manage your work apps and enrolled personal devices. To access the Company Portal website, go to [https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) on any device (it doesn't have to be an enrolled device) and sign in with your work or school account.  

Once you're signed in, you can see your enrolled devices and:  

* [Check status](check-status-company-portal-website.md): Initiate a status check to verify or regain access to your organization's resources.  

* [View and manage work apps](manage-apps-cpweb.md): Search and filter through available work apps, including required and already-installed apps.   

* [Store recovery key](store-recovery-key.md): Store and rotate the FileVault key for an encrypted macOS device.   

* [Get recovery key](get-recovery-key-cpweb.md): Retrieve the stored FileVault key so that you can get back into your locked macOS device.   

* [Remotely lock a device](remote-lock-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Lock a lost or stolen device so no one else can access it.  

* [Rename a device](rename-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Change the generic or default model name that's shown in Company Portal to something you can quickly identify.  

* [Remove a device](remove-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Remove and unenroll a personal device that's no longer needed for work.  

* [Reset a device password](reset-your-passcode-cpwebsite.md): Reset a forgotten password.  

* [Reset device to factory settings](reset-device-company-portal-website.md): Restore a used, lost, or stolen personal device to its out-of-box state.  

Some actions aren't available on all operating systems and device types. The reset device password action, for example, won't work on an Android device that has a work profile.
