# Doc team test

Frank's testing on 07/06/2022

## Basic Markdown and GFM

All basic and Github-flavored markdown is supported. For more information, see:

- [Baseline markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
- [Github-flavored markdown (GFM) documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)

## Headings

Examples of first and second-level headings are above.

There **must** be only one first level heading in your article, which will be displayed as the on-page title.  

Second-level headings will generate the on-page TOC that appears in the "In this article" section underneath the on-page title.

### Third-level heading (`###`)
#### Fourth-level heading (`####`)
##### Fifth-level heading (`#####`)

## Text styling

_Italics_ (`_`)

**Bold** (`**`)

~~Strikethrough~~ (`~~`)

## Links

To link to a markdown file in the same repo, use **file-relative links**. Use the Docs Authoring Pack to help.

Examples:

- [Microsoft Configuration Manager documentation](in-console-documentation.md)
- [Assets in Desktop Analytics](../../desktop-analytics/about-assets.md)

To link to a header in the same markdown file, find the section anchor and link using `#` (for example, `#blockquote`). Use the Docs Authoring Pack to help.

- Example: [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)

To link to a header in a markdown file in the same repo, use relative linking + hashtag linking.

- Example: [Support articles](in-console-documentation.md#support-articles)

To link to another article on docs.ms, use a **root-relative link**.

- Example: [Get-CMSoftwareUpdateDeploymentPackage PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/configurationmanager/get-cmsoftwareupdatedeploymentpackage)

To link to an external file, use the full URL as the link. Remove any locales.

- Example: [GitHub](https://www.github.com)

## Blockquotes

> The drought had lasted now for ten million years, and the reign of the terrible lizards had long since ended. Here on the Equator, in the continent which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for existence had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not yet in sight. In this barren and desiccated land, only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to survive.
