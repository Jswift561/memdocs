Maintenance windows are recurring periods of time when the Configuration Manager client can run tasks. 
PowerShell Commandlet:  ``` New-CMMaintenanceWindow  ``` is used to create a maintenance window for a collection. Earlier the Offset parameter could be set only between 0 and 4. Now it has been extended between 0 to 7.
